# Red Book for Free Aerial Imagery <a href='https://yercizenler.org'><img src='https://yercizenler.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/yer-cizenlerlogo.png' align="right" height="139" /></a>

Very high-resolution (<0.5m) aerial imagery is crucial in pre- and post-disaster scenarios. However, the licenses associated with these images often restrict their use, making them legally inaccessible for most purposes. This document aims to provide you, the GIS professionals, disaster response organizations, and individuals seeking access to high-resolution aerial imagery with a guide to imagery sources that offer licenses, allowing for a wide range of use cases, especially during a crisis. We focus on very high-resolution imagery since they are usually required to digitize physical features for maps like OpenStreetMap.

## Where is Imagery?
Currently, there are many providers for very high-resolution imagery (via satellites, aerial vehicles, drones, etc). Governments or private companies (in tight relations with governments) such as Airbus, Maxar, Planet, and many others have their operations in space or air. Both governments and private companies usually distribute data with 3rd-party companies or institutions. It's not easy to access them without the distributors. There are also community-driven initiatives such as [OpenAerialMap](openaerialmap.org), where people publish their proprietary imagery with free licenses or already free licensed data.

During disasters, many providers contact [International Disaster Charter](https://disasterscharter.org/web/guest/about-the-charter) to align on imagery acquisitions. Although you can see the images acquired on the activations, the charter does share data with you if you meet the criteria mentioned [here](https://disasterscharter.org/web/guest/how-to-register-as-a-user).

## Data Licensing
Depending on your use case, in which part of the Earth you are, your budget, and many other entangled legal and bureaucratic systems, you are not free to use the imagery you see on your screen. For our scope, [this guidance](https://gkhub.earthobservations.org/packages/p0zg8-02b56) and [this article](https://joemorrison.medium.com/the-commercial-satellite-imagery-business-model-is-broken-6f0e437ec29d) are a nice summary of the issues related to legal and economic boundaries.
