High-resolution aerial imagery is a crucial resource in both pre and post-disaster scenarios. However, the licenses associated with these images often restrict their use, making them legally inaccessible for most purposes. This document aims to provide you with a guide to imagery sources that offer licenses, allowing for a wide range of use cases.

> Disclaimer: each disaster is a different case with geopolitical and economic dimensions. There is no guarantee that they will be available for your case. And yes, surprise, it's not a legal advice.
