We need very high resolution aerial imagery during disasters for both before and after the event. The image licenses should enable us to perform whatever we do with them and they just don't most of the time. So, you are mostly not free to use them, legally. This document is intended to guide you in imagery sources shared with licenses that we are free for most of the use-case.

> [!CAUTION]
> Disclaimer: each disaster is a different case with geopolitical and economical dimensions. There is no guarantee on any of them will be available for your case. And yes, it's not a legal advice.
